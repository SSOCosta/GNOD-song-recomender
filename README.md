# GNOD Song Recommender Project

## Overview

This repository hosts the project for the GNOD Song Recommender system, an innovative solution aiming to enhance the music discovery experience. The project is divided into multiple labs, each contributing to the development of a comprehensive song recommendation system.

### Lab | Web Scraping Single Page (GNOD part 1)

#### Objective
- Understanding the business context of Gnod and its existing product, Gnoosic.
- Develop an understanding of the company's strategy and the role of this project.

#### Task
- Scrape current top 100 songs and artists from PopVortex.
- Store the scraped data in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

### Lab | Unsupervised Learning Introduction (GNOD part 4)

#### Goal
- Utilize clustering to improve song recommendations.
- Enhance the recommendation system by including songs with similar audio features.

#### Process
1. Check if the input song is in the PopVortex Hot 100.
2. Recommend another Hot 100 song if it is.
3. If not in the Hot 100, use the Spotify API to collect audio features.
4. Employ a clustering model to categorize the song.
5. Recommend a song from the same cluster.

#### Data Enhancement
- Additional datasets from Kaggle are used to enrich the song database, ensuring a broad range of audio features for accurate clustering.
